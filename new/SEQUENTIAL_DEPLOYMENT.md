# 🚀 Sequential Mode Deployment Checklist

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Verification

### Code Changes
- [x] Added `parse_request_into_steps()` to `refiner.py`
- [x] Added `execute_sequential()` to `refiner.py`
- [x] Updated `orchestrator.py` with sequential trigger logic
- [x] No syntax errors detected
- [x] Import statements updated (`time`, `Optional`)

### Documentation
- [x] Created `SEQUENTIAL_MODE.md` - Feature overview
- [x] Created `EXECUTION_FLOW.md` - Visual flow diagram
- [x] Created `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Complete summary
- [x] Created `tests/test_sequential.py` - Unit tests

### Testing Preparation
- [x] Unit tests for parsing logic created
- [x] Test cases cover all edge cases
- [x] Logging statements added for debugging

## 📋 Deployment Steps

### 1. Code Review
```bash
# Review the changes
git diff new/src/core/refiner.py
git diff new/src/core/orchestrator.py
```

### 2. Commit Changes
```bash
cd new/
git add src/core/refiner.py
git add src/core/orchestrator.py
git add SEQUENTIAL_MODE.md
git add EXECUTION_FLOW.md
git add IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
git add tests/test_sequential.py
git add SEQUENTIAL_DEPLOYMENT.md

git commit -m "feat: Add sequential execution mode for complex multi-change requests

- Parse complex requests into individual operations
- Execute operations sequentially with full model competition per step
- Automatically triggered after 3 failed normal iterations
- Each step uses ALL models in parallel
- Chains results: step N output → step N+1 input
- Falls back to hybrid if sequential also fails
- Added comprehensive logging and documentation"
```

### 3. Push to Repository
```bash
git push origin main
```

### 4. Deploy to Railway
```bash
railway up
```

## 🧪 Post-Deployment Testing

### Test Case 1: Simple Request (Should NOT trigger sequential)
**Request:**
```
"αλλαξε το 20% σε 30%. Όλα τα υπολοιπα να μεινουνε ακριβως ιδια"
```

**Expected:**
- Normal mode handles it
- No sequential mode trigger
- `model_used` without "(sequential)" suffix

### Test Case 2: Complex Request (Should trigger sequential after 3 failures)
**Request:**
```
"βαλε το λογοτυπο δεξια τελειως, αλλαξε το 20% σε 30% 
και γραψε κατω απο το 'ΓΙΑ 48 ΩΡΕΣ' τη φραση 'ΕΚΤΟΣ ΑΠΟ FREDDO'
Όλα τα υπολοιπα να μεινουνε ακριβως ιδια"
```

**Expected:**
- Normal iterations 1-3 attempt (and likely fail)
- Logs show: "Failed 3 iterations - switching to SEQUENTIAL mode"
- Request parsed into 3 steps
- Each step executed sequentially
- Success with `model_used: "{model} (sequential)"`

### Test Case 3: Sequential Failure (Should trigger hybrid)
**Request:**
```
"[Request that fails even with sequential]"
```

**Expected:**
- Normal iterations fail
- Sequential mode attempts
- Sequential mode fails
- Hybrid fallback triggered
- Human review notification sent

## 📊 Monitoring Checklist

### Watch for These Log Patterns

#### ✅ Success Indicators
```
🔗 SEQUENTIAL MODE: Executing N steps
🔗 SEQUENTIAL STEP X/N
✅ STEP X PASSED
🏆 Best: {model} with score X/10
🎉 ALL SEQUENTIAL STEPS COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!
```

#### ❌ Failure Indicators
```
❌ STEP X FAILED - No passing results
💥 SEQUENTIAL MODE FAILED AT STEP X/N
```

#### 🔍 Parsing Indicators
```
🔗 Parsing request into sequential steps
📋 Parsed into N sequential steps
```

### Railway Dashboard Metrics
- [ ] Check response times (may be longer for sequential)
- [ ] Monitor memory usage (multiple model calls per step)
- [ ] Watch for errors in logs
- [ ] Verify webhook success rate

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Sequential mode not triggering
**Check:**
- Normal iterations completing 3 full cycles?
- Request contains multiple operations?
- Parsing logic detecting operations correctly?

### Issue: Parsing not splitting correctly
**Check:**
- Presence of commas or "και" in request
- Preservation clause format
- Log output of parsed steps

### Issue: Sequential steps failing
**Check:**
- Individual step validation scores
- Which model failing at which step
- Original image comparison working?

### Issue: High execution time
**Expected:**
- Sequential mode IS slower (multiple full cycles)
- Each step: 4 models × enhancement + generation + validation
- Trade-off for handling complex requests

## 🎯 Success Criteria

- [ ] Code deploys without errors
- [ ] Simple requests still work in normal mode
- [ ] Complex requests trigger sequential after 3 failures
- [ ] Sequential mode successfully chains steps
- [ ] Logs show clear step progression
- [ ] Final images show "(sequential)" in model_used
- [ ] Hybrid fallback still works as safety net

## 📞 Support

### If Issues Arise

1. **Check logs** for error patterns
2. **Review test cases** to isolate issue
3. **Rollback if critical**: `git revert <commit-hash>`
4. **Debug with simple request** first
5. **Gradually increase complexity**

## 🎉 Success Metrics

After 24-48 hours of deployment:

- [ ] Sequential mode triggered successfully
- [ ] Some complex requests resolved via sequential
- [ ] No regressions in simple request handling
- [ ] Hybrid fallback rate decreased
- [ ] User satisfaction improved for complex edits
